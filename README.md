# The C± Language

Welcome to C±. This is a compiler project written using Rust and LLVM.

Its main purpose is to be a "teach myself Rust" project. What that means is that you may see a variety of coding styles and conventions as I learn more.

A secondary purpose is to build a fun little language in the C family. C± aims to be simple, usable, reasonable and yet fun.

The language is new enough that tests and sample programs are the extent of the "documentation". As it progresses to maturity, it should eventually be possible to write non-trivial programs in the language, compile them and expect them to run with decent enough performance. More documentation will come at that point.

However, C± does not aim to be a stable production-quality language and it is highly discouraged to use it as the foundation for software that anyone depends on.

Sending patches is very welcome, provided that they don't break any tests, add tests whenever possible, and they fit in the overall architecture of the project.

Above all, enjoy and be excellent to one another.
