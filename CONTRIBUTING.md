# How to contribute to this project

First of all, thanks for being interested in CÂ±.

I am happy you are here and look forward to reviewing and merging your contributions to the project.

A few notes on how to make this process as easy and seamless as possible.

## Coding style

I would rather much discuss the semantics of your contribution than the way it is formatted, so this project adopts automated checks.

My local flow uses [precommit](https://pre-commit.com/) and I encourage you to use it as well.

By default it will run `cargo format`, `cargo check` and `cargo clippy`. If those all pass, then you're golden. The same checks will happen at GitHub and if they fail, I will ask you to resubmit until they pass. Run them locally and spare yourself (and me) the trouble. If a `clippy` check doesn't make sense, you can add a marker to ignore it, but that is likely to lead to extra scrutiny if the issue isn't obvious.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under Apache 2.0. I ask that you submit patches under your real name and under the same license. If you can't do either of those, I can't accept your patch. A [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/) is sufficient for this purpose.

## Testing

There are two testing styles in this project:
- **out of band JIT tests**: these are great for simple single file tests with no additional dependencies and which do not need to check for specific error messages or results and can simply return 0 to signal success; they will run with and without optimization;
- **out of band driver tests**: these can compile multiple files, will eventually be able to link external libraries and validate error messages, and work really well to test things that can easily crash (LLVM edge cases, failed assertions, memory smashers); they are intended to run with and without optimization;

When you submit a patch, make sure no tests break. Add tests for your work. If you can't add a test, this will make the patch subject to extra scrutiny before being merged.

## Large-scale changes

While contributions are welcome, some things may be explicitly out of scope for one reason or another, so please reach out before you embark on any major architectural change. Maybe I am thinking about it already, maybe I am thinking of doing it differently, or maybe I'd rather not have it there at all. Reaching out ahead of time is the best way to avoid wasting time.

Thanks for reading and happy hacking.
